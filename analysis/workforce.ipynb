    "[Areas in Toronto often have an industry majority. For instance, Bay St. is famously known for being the Wall Street of the North and housing headquarters for the five main Canadian banks. In this same sense, Wards can also have a majority industry. The following graph reveals how there are more Starbucks stores in wards which especially have a high number of workers in Mgmt. of Companies/Enterprises (Enterprise Mgmt. Bros), Real Estate/Rental/Leasing (Real-Estate Bros), and Finance/Insurance (Finance Bros). This general fit in the incline of the # _ Bros and the # Starbucks stores is strong, despite the rough, fluctuating starts of all 3 industry lines.]\n",
