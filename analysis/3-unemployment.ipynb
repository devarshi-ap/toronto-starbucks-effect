    "This graph reveals that you find more Starbucks stores as you travel into Wards with lower unemployment rates. It is important to note the weak proportional delta between the two; a high decline unemployment rate doesn't equate to a high incline in Starbucks stores. This makes sense, because had the unemployment rate dropped from 85 to 65, you're chances of running into a Starbucks in those Wards are slim to none. We do still find Starbucks stores spiking in Wards where unemployment is at its lowest in the entire city. This also holds on the opposite end of the spectrum since the fewest amount of Starbucks stores are found when unemployment is at its highest (Ward 24). The # stores fluctuates steadily < 5 until you reach an unemployment rate < 7.5%.\n",
