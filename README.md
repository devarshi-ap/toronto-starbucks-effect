# <em>Analysis of "Starbucks Effect" in Toronto</em>
This is a repository for getting experience in data analysis. All analysis was done by me, Devarshi Patel.<br />
The datasets, Jupyter notebook, and Tableau workbook used in the project are also included in this repository.<br />
The full report is also included in this repository.

## Introduction
`Starbucks Effect` : describes the phenomena of increasing home and property values in the neighbourhoods surrounding a new Starbucks location.<br />
An article by Zillow claimed that if you lived within 0.25 miles of a Starbucks location, the value of your home would have grown by 96% from 1997 to 2014.<br />

Starbucks is about more than jut coffee. You‚Äôre paying for a nice social and work-space to sit in while you drink your coffee. Walk into most Starbucks and you‚Äôll see lots of people working on laptops and other devices, using it as an on-the-road office or a break-from-the-regular-office workplace. But why is this? The most violent Starbucks store incident/experience is almost the nicest, most wholesome Tim Hortons one. But again, why? <br />

üå± Using locally-sourced datasets of neighbourhood profiles in the city of Toronto and Starbucks locations, I aim to figure out why, to an extent, the ‚ÄúStarbucks Effect‚Äù stands true.

## `Methodology`
### üêç `Python Libraries`
The libraries used on this project include:
* Pandas ‚Äì For storing and manipulating structured data. Pandas functionality is built on NumPy
* Plotly Visualization Package ‚Äì For all visualizations (including maps and graphs)
*	Requests - to send HTTP requests easily
*	SQLAlchemy - SQL object-relation mapper (ORM) for making queries to MySQL

### üõ†Ô∏è `Tools`
Other tools used in this project include:
* MySQL (TablePlus) - my choice of database management system
* Kaggle - online community of open source datasets
* City of Toronto Open Data - official source for Toronto open data from City divisions and agencies
* Tableau Cloud - great online analytics platform for creating visualizations
* dbdiagram.io - designing the database tables based on the relevant datasets collected
